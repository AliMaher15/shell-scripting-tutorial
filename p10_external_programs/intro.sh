# External programs are often used within shell scripts
# there are a few builtin commands (echo, which, and test are commonly builtin),
# but many useful commands are actually Unix utilities, such as tr, grep, expr and cut.

# The backtick (`) is also often associated with external commands. 
# Because of this, we will discuss the backtick first.
